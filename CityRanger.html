                              <p>Computer programming has Learning computer programming gives children a practical way to build problem-solving and communication skills. In recent years, it has become an essential component of the curriculum in K-12 education. Many of coding tools designed for children, however, contain a bunch of words, numbers, and blocks that they can hardly understand. The goal of this project was to create and design an age-appropriate educational digital technology for children aged 5 to 7 years old to teach them fundamental concepts of programming and enhance their computational thinking.</p>

                         <p>I went to Austin Central Library and observed the participant, a 8-year-old boy, playing a web-based coding game on iPad, Bits and Bricks. <mark>The objectives of the observation were to understand how children interact with a coding game and what obstacles they would encounter as for their limited cognitive abilities.</mark> Here are the key takeaways derived from the observation:</p>
                         <br>
                         <ul>
                         <li><b>Easy to habituate to the old strategy</b><br><p>The boy would stick to the old strategies which were not effective but feasible. For example, he would not choose the shortest path to the destination, instead, he took the one take more steps but workable.</p></li>
                         <li><b>Examining the sequences repeatedly during the process</b><br><p>In each task, the boy did not complete the sequence at once. Rather, he tended to use play button to check the sequence when he added some blocks to it and repeated this process until he complete the existing task.</p></li>
                         <li><b>Provide appropriate signifiers and feedback</b><br><p>The boy learned the rules through trails and errors. Sometimes, however, he had difficulties to identify the errors and what actions were possible due to the insufficient of signifiers and feedback.</p></li>

                         <p>After observation, I invited the participant to share his favorite game or app and why those are his favoriate with me. It could help me understand what portential elements I could include in my design. I also interviewed the participant's parents to learn about their children's use of technology, as well as their attitude and beliefs toward how technology influence children to. Main questions include:</p>
                         <ul>
                              <li>Can you descibe how your child usually use technology, such as teblets and mobile phones? </li>
                              <li>Can you describe how you choose a game or an app for your child? Or does he download by himself?</li>

Thus, it is important to consider children's cognitive development before designing technology for them. <mark>I conducted the literature review to have deep understandings about child development and what age-appropriate experiences that I can create for young children to learn computational thinking successfully.</mark> Here are some highlights from literature review:</p>

                         <p>The definitions of computational thinking are varied in different studies, there is little agreement on what components computational thinking might encompass. Considering help young children acquire age-appropriate experiences in the game, I adopted Bers’s (2017) seven developmentally appropriate ideas of computational thinking for early childhood computer science education.</p>
