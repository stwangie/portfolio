                              <p>Numerous research have demonstrated beneficial effects of mindfulness meditation on health, emotion, and cognition, such as immune function and emotional self-regulation. Nowadays, with thousands of new meditation app on the market, people can easily access to guided courses and learn how to meditate. However, mindfulness meditation seems simple, but not easy. The beginners may have doubts about the efficacy of meditation, unpleasant experience during meditation, difficulty maintaining attention, and so forth. The issue of how to alleviate these difficulties to help beginners not give up halfway becomes critical. We then decided to design and prototype a meditation app that can encourage beginners to meditate on a regular basis.</p>

The common difficulties they underwent were doubt of the effect of meditation/expectancy violation, uncertainty of self-efficacy to engage, difficulty maintaining cognitive focus, physical issue, and finding time to meditate. The explaination of doubts are as follows:</p>

                              <p>To identify what features are needed for our app to keep and differentieted from others, we conducted a competitive analysis, selecting five meditation apps as direct competitors and two self-care apps as indirect competitors which deliver similar meditation function as well. We analyzed features of customization, content, social support, tracking progress, and rewards.</p>

                         <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                         <br>
                         <ul>
                         <li><b>Providing users with rewards as alternative feedback</b><br><p>Some of the competitors give rewards to users when they attain a certain goal. Most of them, however, do not make the rewards salient. We suggested that our app can amplify the reward mechanism to motivate beginners to keep meditating since hardly can they acquire immediate feedback from meditation.</p></li>
                         <li><b>Including the feature of tracking psychological state</b><br><p>Though tracking progress is a common feature shared by all competitors, only one of them track psychological status which have been studied related to mindfulness meditation and usually is one of the qualities that people care about when they practice meditation. We proposed that adding the feature of tracking psychological state can help users observe their changes thus strengthen their self-regulation.</p></li>
                         <li><b>Building stronger connection between users</b><br><p>Except for Inside Timer, other competitors do not build really strong bonding between users. The enlistment of social support, however, can encourage people’s efforts to exert self-control. Therefore, we can build up this feature to let users gain more companionship from others.</p></li>

                              <p>We gathered and translated the insights from previous research and identified “motivating beginners to meditate on a regular basis” as an attempt of behavior change. We then reviewed the health behavior change   theories and models which we learned from the class to help us propose solutions. Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) is the primary theory that we adopted to inform our design since it considers the dynamic interplay of individuals, groups, and environmental influences. It helped us pinpoint what determinants can be considered while coming up with the solutions.</p>
