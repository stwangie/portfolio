                              <p>Numerous research have demonstrated beneficial effects of mindfulness meditation on health, emotion, and cognition, such as immune function and emotional self-regulation. Nowadays, with thousands of new meditation app on the market, people can easily access to guided courses and learn how to meditate. However, mindfulness meditation seems simple, but not easy. The beginners may have doubts about the efficacy of meditation, unpleasant experience during meditation, difficulty maintaining attention, and so forth. The issue of how to alleviate these difficulties to help beginners not give up halfway becomes critical. We then decided to design and prototype a meditation app that can encourage beginners to meditate on a regular basis.</p>

                         <li><b>Providing users with rewards as alternative feedback</b><br><p>Some of the competitors give rewards to users when they attain a certain goal. Most of them, however, do not make the rewards salient. We suggested that our app can amplify the reward mechanism to motivate beginners to keep meditating since hardly can they acquire immediate feedback from meditation.</p></li>
                         <li><b>Including the feature of tracking psychological state</b><br><p>Though tracking progress is a common feature shared by all competitors, only one of them track psychological status which have been studied related to mindfulness meditation and usually is one of the qualities that people care about when they practice meditation. We proposed that adding the feature of tracking psychological state can help users observe their changes thus strengthen their self-regulation.</p></li>
                         <li><b>Building stronger connection between users</b><br><p>Except for Inside Timer, other competitors do not build really strong bonding between users. The enlistment of social support, however, can encourage people’s efforts to exert self-control. Therefore, we can build up this feature to let users gain more companionship from others.</p></li>

                              <p>We gathered and translated the insights from previous research and identified “motivating beginners to meditate on a regular basis” as an attempt of behavior change. We then reviewed the health behavior change   theories and models which we learned from the class to help us propose solutions. Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) is the primary theory that we adopted to inform our design since it considers the dynamic interplay of individuals, groups, and environmental influences. It helped us pinpoint what determinants can be considered while coming up with the solutions.</p>

The testings helped us to learn what aspects of the the interface are confusing.

                         <p>To address the issues we found in the usability testing, we redesigned our prototype. First, we redesigned the feature of  "meditating with friends." Because it was where all of our participants in usability testing would go when they tried to meditate with their friends, we put their appointments with others in the calendar under Friends section. By viewing calendar, they can also have a clearer understanding of their schedule than before. <br><br>
                         Second, since two of our participants said that they could not really perceive the difference between meditating along and with others, as well as feel motivated to meditate with friends, we added a feature of "Friendship Level" as an achievement to motivate users to meditate with friends. However, whether meditating remotely can really bring users psychological changes is still a question that we need to answer. Lastly, we change the confusing labels and icons that made the participant confused, which included name of Sessions, as well as the icon of garden and assessment. Ultimately, we kept the name Garden because we thought the name "Garden" is more consistent to our design concept. Nevertheless, we altered the description at the finishing page when users get their rewards to let them know the flowers they got will be kept in the "garden."</p>

                         <p align="left">Through this project, I learned how to use Figma to build prototype efficiently. From the usability testing, although it was frustrating while seeing the participants failed on the tasks or felt confused about the icons, I was greatiful I've learned that the gap of mental model between designers and users is a critical issue that we cannot neglect as a UX designer. This gap will always remind me to include users in mind and never automatically assume that the users can understand what we intend to convey through the design.
